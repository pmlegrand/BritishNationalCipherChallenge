<H3>Hint for Challenge 4</H3>
<P>If you haven't tried frequency analysis yet on Challenge 4, now might =
be a=20
good time to try it. Look at the documents too, who has sent them, who =
do you=20
think they sent them to? Does that help you guess any of the words? Are =
there=20
any words you expect to see in the text that might help as you decrypt? =
</P>
<P>More hints as time goes by. No need to panic, you have two weeks!</P>

<H3>Challenge 4</H3>
<P>Challenge 4 is now up, good luck to all of you. Part A is a little =
tougher=20
this week, so keep your eyes on the Notebook for hints (from me and from =
other=20
competitors, though I may hold back some of their hints for a while if =
they try=20
to give away too much too soon). You have two weeks to tackle this one. =
The=20
deadline is 23.59 on Wednesday 3rd November. Good luck,</P>

<H3>Another hint for 3B</H3>
<P>If you are having trouble shuffling columns of text around can I =
suggest=20
typing the text into cells in an Excel spreadsheet nine across like =
this</P>
<P>H E R E I S A T E<BR>S T P I E C E O F<BR>T E X T</P>
<P>then rearrange the columns by cutting and pasting then copying the =
text into=20
notepad. Hope this helps anyone who has nearly got it. All the best, =

<H3>Hint for 3B</H3>
<P>Cracked 3A and stuck on 3B? Here's a hint. Frequency analysis should =
tell you=20
that this is unlikely to be a substitution cipher, but it should be easy =
to=20
untangle, especially if you like cryptic crosswords. GOod luck,</P>

<H3>Prizes and info for Challenge 3</H3>
<P>Challenge 3 (parts A and B) has been posted and you have until =
11.59pm on=20
Wednesday 20th October to crack the messages. Good luck. For a change we =
will be=20
giving cash prizes to lucky winners selected by a random draw from among =
those=20
who submit a correct decryption of Challenge 3A! There will be ten of =
these =C2=A325=20
prizes this week.</P>
<P>What about prizes for Challenge B this week? Fame and glory are on =
offer=20
since this one is tricky - I'd try part A first if I were you. Of course =
a good=20
score in Challenge 3B could put you out in front for the GCHQ =
Championship=20
Prize, so give it your best shot. </P>
<P>All the best,</P>

<H3>Challenge 2B</H3>
<P>Still up? Still wondering what sort of cipher 2B is? As several of =
you have=20
hinted it is an affine shift cipher. There are only 312 different affine =
ciphers=20
so it shouldn't be too hard to crack, but if you haven't seen one before =
it=20
looks a lot like a subsitution cipher where the cipher alphabet is a =
random=20
rearrangement of the usual alphabet (there are a LOT more of these =
randomised=20
ciphers - any guesses how many there are?). You can find a method for =
speeding=20
up the cracking of an affine shift ciphers in the Teachers Pack. =
Otherwise you=20
can just use frequency analysis and guesswork, though you have to watch =
out for=20
odd abbreviations and so on.</P>
<P><BR>Solutions tomorrow. Get ready for Challenge 3!</P>

<H3>Another Hint</H3>
<P>Some odd letters puzzling you in the text? Think we've made a =
mistake?=20
Sometimes people used abbreviations in a telegram (maybe for a name, for =

example) to cut down on the length of a text. All will become clear =

<H3>Hint for 2B</H3>
<P>OK, if you've been watching the comments on this site you'll have =
seen=20
several people suggest that you should think about the clues you have. =
Challenge=20
2B is a telegram. Messages in telegrams were often punctuated using the =
word=20
STOP in place of the fullstop. So maybe you can find that word srpinkled =
through=20
the message and maybe, just maybe, that is enough of a crib to crack the =
rest of=20
the cipher. Hope so. Maybe another hint tomorrow. Just maybe. Sleep =
well,</P>

<H3>Challenge 2B</H3>
<P>Why are all the words in Challenge 2B four or five letters long? They =
are=20
not. It is common practice to regroup the letters in a ciphertext into =
groups of=20
five to disguise the words so you can't use the shape of the words to =
guess=20
them. Why not just write them out without any spaces at all? Because it =
is easy=20
to make a mistake copying them down that way.</P>
<P>The upshot is you have to try to figure out the letters by frequency =
analysis=20
and guesswork. Use what you already know. See a strange word in the =
text? Maybe=20
it is an abbreviation or a foreign word or name. Have you seem it before =
in the=20
Challenge? Are there any unusal words you might expect to see?</P>
<P>Keep trying. </P>

<P>The two most common letters in English text are E and =

(WHOOPS - sorry about the typo, I meant) T. Depending on the text either =
could=20

<H3>Feedback</H3>
<P>Submitted and wondering when you will find out how you did? We will =
be=20
sending out our first email feedback tonight and early tomorrow. You =
will get=20
one email for each submission you made and it will tell you how you did. =
If you=20
made a mistake it will highlight one of them so you can start to debug =
your=20
solution and try again.</P>
<P>We will publish the Hall of Fame for Challenge 1 on Thursday.</P>

<H3>Challenge 1B</H3>
<P>One or two of you have asked if Challenge 1B is encrypted using a =
random=20
substitution cipher. That would be no fun at all! A copy of Simon =
Singh's The=20
Code Book CD to the first person to correctly identify the type of =
cipher we=20
used, but don't give away the key in your answer, we still want to give =
people a=20
chance to try and crack the cipher themselves and you don't want to make =
it too=20
easy for your competitors.</P>

<H3>First Hint for Challenge 1</H3>
<P>New to cipher cracking? If you don't know where to begin you could =
try=20
looking at our notes on cracking subsitution ciphers which you will find =
in the=20
Teachers' Pack<BR><A=20

<P>The best way to tackle a ciphertext like those in Challenge 1 is =
probably to=20
use frequency analysis. This is a fancy way of saying that you should =
count up=20
the letters in the text to figure out which appear most often. Since E =
and S are=20
usually the most common letters in a plain English text it is almost =
certain=20
that the most common letter in the ciphertext represents E. </P>
<P>You can also use the fact that these messages seem to have been =
encrypted=20
with the word structure intact to try and identify common words like =
"the" and=20
"a".</P>
<P>Good luck,</P>
